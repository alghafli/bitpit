0.0.6:
    - initial release
1.0.0:
    - Emitter class:
        - emit() no longer gives self as an argument.
        - emit() takes *args positional arguments that will be passed to
          callbacks.
        - listen() now takes *args and **kwargs. these will be passed to
          callbacks. *args in emit() come first before *args in listen().
        - unlisten() now takes *args and **kwargs. these must be the same values
          passed to listen() in order to unlisten the callback.
    - Downloader class:
        - rearranged constructor arguments order to make more frequently used
          arguments first.
        - changed ``chunk_size`` default value to 4 KB.
        - added ``dir_path`` argument.
        - rewritten attributes using @property decorator with some attributes
          writable while others are only readable.
        - added ``restart_time`` property.
        - changed ``start`` state to mean the downloader just started but no
          downloading is actually happening. only attempting to connect.
        - added ``download`` state.
        - now ``error`` state means an error occured and it is expected to be
          temporary.
        - added ``fatal-error`` state for errors that are expected to reoccure
          if the download is restarted. no automatic restart happens if the
          downloader stopped due to fatal error.
        - added the following signals:
            - url-changed
            - path-changed
            - restart-time-changed
            - rate-limit-changed
        - when the downloader gets the file size, it only emits ``size-changed``
          signal when the new size is different from the old size.
        - modify all emit() calls to keep the behaviour of previous version
          after changing Emitter methods listen(), unlisten() and emit().
    - added Manager class
    - update documentation and add library reference.
1.1.0:
    - changed ``min_period`` property name in Manager class to ``restart_wait``
      to match the naming of Downloader class.
    - changed the meaning of ``restart_wait`` property in Manager class to mean
      the minimum time to keep a download paused before it is started again. now
      manager updates can happen frequently if needed but a single download will
      not be started too frequently.
    - changed in internal implementation of restart thread in Downloader and in
      schedule thread in Manager. now both use Timer class from threading
      module.
    - minor changes in tutorial.
